## Why ChatBots? ##

---

## Tutorial Overview ##

#### Demo Code #####
+ "SimpleBot" - starting point: learn basic conversations by example
+ Limitations as a background for NLP and ML motivation


#### Python Notebooks ####
1. Introduction to NLTK - Explore a Corpus and Treebank
2.
3.
4.

#### Demo Code ####
+ "NLBBot" - introduce the concepts and capabilities listed above

#### Setting Expectations ####
+ "Broad not deep" - basic concepts and tools only

## "SimpleBot" Limitations and Missing Logic ##

#### Word and Grammer Classification ####
Sense of Word is not considered in the flow
+ What is the general topic
+ We want to focus on the Subject and Object
+ EG:
    - Where is the cat going to?
	- Where is the dog going to?

#### Sentence Classification ####
Class of sentence affects flow
+ Questions need answers (not another question)
+ Chat is just chat
+ Statements need to be filed away and noted (and the flow stops there)
+ Recognise when we are getting feedback about previous sentence

## Natural Language Processing (NLP) ##

** Excerpts from Wikipedia **

+ Interactions between computers and human (natural) languages

+ Fruitfully process large natural language corpora
   - Large samples of "real world" text, usually classified

+ Natural language understanding, natural language generation

+ Managing human-computer dialog systems

## Introducing the Python Natural Language Toolkit ##

+ Python NLTK - http://www.nltk.org/
  - Open Source package for Natural Language Processing
  - Written in Python
  - Originated at University of Pennsylvania (Steven Bird and Edward Loper)
+ spaCy - https://spacy.io
  - High performance Cython library for NLP
+ Stanford CoreNLP - https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/
  - Written in Java with good interface to NLTK

## Corpus ##

Penn Treebank - the first large-scale treebank


## PunkT ##

sent_tokenize uses an instance of PunktSentenceTokenizer from the nltk. tokenize.punkt module

Using a PunktTrainer directly allows for incremental training and modification of the hyper-parameters used to decide what is considered an abbreviation etc

---

## Core Resourses ##

NLTK Book

Treebank - uses regular expressions to tokenize text as found in Penn Treebank

Punkt - pre trained version or train your own. Non-Supervised learning algorithm
